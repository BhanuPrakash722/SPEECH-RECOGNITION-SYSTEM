# DESCRIPTION
During my internship at CodTech IT Solutions, I successfully completed a project focused on developing a Speech Recognition System for Command-Based Control of Devices using an embedded board. The project aimed to create a system capable of recognizing voice commands and controlling devices accordingly. The system was built around an embedded development board and a microphone module for capturing voice input. I integrated a basic speech recognition module to interpret predefined commands, such as "Turn ON," "Turn OFF," and "Start." The voice commands were processed using custom firmware written in C/C++, allowing the embedded system to execute corresponding actions, like switching on an LED or activating a motor. This hands-on experience allowed me to gain deeper knowledge of speech processing techniques, embedded system programming, and hardware-software integration. One of the challenges I faced was improving the accuracy of speech recognition in noisy environments, which I addressed by fine-tuning the system to filter out background noise. The project demonstrated the potential of speech interfaces in real-time embedded systems and their practical applications in areas such as home automation, industrial control, and assistive technologies. Through this experience, I enhanced my technical skills and expanded my understanding of embedded systems, providing a strong foundation for future innovations in the field.
